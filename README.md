# liri-node-app

Liri can search for details of songs, movies and upcoming concerts by utilizing the following three commands:

* concert-this + `<band or artist>`
* spotify-this-song + `<title of a song>`
* movie-this + `<movie title>`

User can also use "do-what-it-says" command to call a random.txt. Liri will read the file and execute a command listed in that file. 

In addition to providing search results on a console screen, Liri also saves your search results in log.txt file.
